CROSS-TIME CORRELATION ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================

PURPOSE:
This analysis tests whether Fisher information at time step i
is correlated with reward standard deviation at time step j
where i ≠ j (different time steps).

THEORETICAL EXPECTATION:
Fisher information and reward variance at different time steps
should be UNCORRELATED (null hypothesis). This is because:
1. Fisher info measures local loss landscape curvature
2. Reward std measures output consistency
3. These should be independent across different training iterations

DATA SUMMARY:
Total cross-time pairs analyzed: 3
Valid correlations calculated: 1
Invalid correlations (NaN): 2

CORRELATION STATISTICS:
Mean correlation: -0.058840
Standard deviation: nan
Minimum correlation: -0.058840
Maximum correlation: -0.058840

SIGNIFICANCE ANALYSIS:
Statistically significant (p < 0.05): 0/1 (0.0%)
Not statistically significant: 1/1 (100.0%)
Mean p-value: 0.925126

DETAILED RESULTS:
Fisher(t=170) vs Reward_Std(t=380):
  Correlation: -0.058840
  P-value: 0.925126
  Sample size: 5
  Time difference: 210
  Significance: Non-significant

INTERPRETATION:
✓ SUPPORTS NULL HYPOTHESIS: Correlations are weak and non-significant
✓ This is exactly what we expect theoretically
✓ Fisher information and reward std at different time steps are uncorrelated

CONCLUSION:
The cross-time correlation analysis demonstrates that Fisher information
and reward standard deviation measured at different training iterations
are uncorrelated, supporting our theoretical understanding that these
metrics should be independent across time steps.
